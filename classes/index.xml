      <description>This is a new course that combines lectures on campus in College Park with a study abroad component in Havana, Cuba.
 The lectures on campus will focus on different strategies for studying foreign policy decision making.
 The class will travel to Cuba to learn about several foreign policy events that shaped much of the foreign policy of the United States in this region.
 Financial aid and/or need-based scholarships may be available.</description>
